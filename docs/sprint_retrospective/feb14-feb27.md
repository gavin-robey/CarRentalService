# Sprint Retrospective (Feb 14 - Feb 27)

## What Went Well

This week, our team started work on the meat of our project using Django. Our team is getting along well, we have worked out a software architecture which will minimize conflicts in programming design choices, using separate “apps” for the Customer, Manager, and Employee sections. They share a database.

## What Didn't Go Well

Sprint meetings are still our biggest challenge, since schedules don’t line up as well as they would ideally. We’ve kept meeting about 3 times per week, either in the classroom during lecture time, or on a Discord voice chat in the evenings.

## What Specific Things We Can Do To Improve

In the future, we can set a specific schedule for standup meetings and stick to it.

## Team Member Contributions

We haven’t measured contributions in an exact way, but everyone seems to be doing their part. 

- 40% - Gavin has gone above what’s required and created a customer view prototype, reservations table, and reservation UI. He also made some basic styling improvements.
- 30% - Jacob C is scrum master for now. He's implemented the Vehicles model and started on getting images to work.
- 30% - Jacob S has completed everything that needs to be done with user profiles (including both employee and customer).
