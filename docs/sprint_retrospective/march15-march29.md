# Sprint Retrospective (March 14th to March 29th)

## What Went Well: 
  * Original Database designs had no problems when it came to integration throughout the project
  * Very little re-design was required
  * Page UI design was straightfoward
  * Team communication throughout this sprint was phenominal
  * No merge conflicts
 
## What didn't go well:
  * There were some issues with node.js and tailwind not working on all devices
  * We could have spread our workload accross the sprint more evenly, most tasks were done all at once
  * We could have gone back and studied the requirements of the project again as some features were not implemented
 
## What specific things we can do to improve:
  * I think time management could be better for all of us as we pushed off most of the development to the end of the sprint 
  * When it comes to installations of third-party packages, we could have met in person to all install these technologies, to address issues with the process

## Team Member Percentages: 
  * Gavin Robey: 33.33%
  * Jacob Cheney: 33.33%
  * Jacob Smith: 33.33%
  * Madison Jensen: 0%
  * Throughout the sprint  Jacob Cheney acted as the scum master, updating the jira file and creating the standup reports.
